leave blocks).\n* Customize what tools can be used (add more axes, allow everything, ...).\n* Turn leaf breaking on/off.\n* Option to disable the effect of the mod by sneaking (can be reversed).\n* Change speed depending on the tree size.\n* Damage tools or not (can set it to break the tool by the amount of blocks there were in the tree).\n* Let tools at 1 durability if it's going to

\"realistic\".</p></center><br>\n\n## Background\nThis idea revolves around the fact that as of this writing, no such mods for early game realism are present in the Fabric mod database. Then I thought, \"Fine, I'll do it myself.\" Moreover, it was inspired by two particular Forge mods that have the same premise, namely [No Tree Punching](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) and [Natural Progression](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions).\n\n## Features\n\n- Disabled the ability to get wood from punching trees\n- Proper tools are required to collect stone and wood\n- Chopping logs to make planks, and planks to sticks\n- Rocks and sticks are naturally generated around the world\n- Cobblestone variants\n- Makeshift flint tools\n- Copper items, tools and armor\n- Knives and saws serving as alternatives\n\nMore details are in the [wiki](https://jayceecreates.github.io/earlygame/wiki).\n\n## Screenshots\n<details><summary>Show</summary>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/807114433787854868/810885401043533824/2021-02-15_22.26.53.png\">\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/807114433787854868/810885396292042822/2021-02-15_22.34.08.png\">\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/807114433787854868/810886920053194782/2021-02-15_22.19.59.png\">\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/807114433787854868/810885400595922954/2021-02-15_22.18.33.png\">\n</p>\n</details>\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\n- **[Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)**\n  - 1.16: 0.30.0+1.16 and above\n  - 1.17: 0.34.9+1.17 and above\n  - 1.18: 0.51.1+1.18.2 and above\n  - 1.19: 0.57.0+1.19 and above\n- **[Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)**: required for 1.17 and above\n\n### Optional\n\n- **[Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)**: in-game configuration\n- **[Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items)**: for crafting new tools\n\n## Known Issues\n\nIncompatibilities and bugs can be reported in the [issues](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/issues) section.\n\n## Recommended Mods\n\n- **[Unlit Campfire](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unlit-campfire)**: placing campfires on unlit state by default (1.16)\n\n## Credits\n\n- **Fabric Discord community** (a great help for the code)\n- **Contributors** (for the help with issue fixes and other modifications)\n- **You** (for playing with this mod!)\n\n### Any plans for a Forge version?\n\nA Forge version of this particular mod is not necessary.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">üì• Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# üìà Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow.

Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ‚öôÔ∏è Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# üêõ How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2023-12-18T20:49:45.956801Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1101952,"followers":2169,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.16.1","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b"],"loaders":["fabric","liteloader","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF","giebTOyU","teGodXxG","Vt7ls0pO","3JQQCViD","douonZQK","WswrXhsm","LIWEWgbC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"3fEb2K4u","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4","version_number":"1.6.4","changelog":"- Backported fixes from [1.7.0](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.7.0)\n- Fixed crash when running alongside Pehkui #191","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-22T10:50:21.645382Z","downloads":359406,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ca03578ac0ce30c50c9b644babe2db1c7125c669","sha512":"0bd6fbc394920839802827639e5073a86948d8db48553c334969ab35c7239610b1f0c4de703f0b1fbf15859db9630fae7ef9f12fb367bf87ad8890f4fa5c5d6f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/versions/3fEb2K4u/PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar","filename":"PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar","primary":true,"size":7221534,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"hfsU4hXq","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GvrerX1T","user":{"id":"8a7Nm6u3","username":"Sollace","name":"¬≠Sollace","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6429283?v=4","bio":"¬≠","created":"2020-12-01T08:11:42.703275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.6.4.jar"},"mods\\spiderstpo-fabric-1.19.2-2.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"3d65c50b6b160d65ca0ae0ae7c3dd39b2aa184dd50b27c0954c6a15ef9474afc9339836bd051f8450951d9ef9ad016c56ebe7169f3aafff29c65f2359080a672","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"dOGM7ccu","slug":"nyfs-spiders","project_type":"mod","team":"y8nPyT9A","title":"Nyf's Spiders","description":"Modifes spiders to be more realistic","body":"This is a Fork and Continuation of Spiders 2.0 by TheCyberBrick\n\n\n# Nyf's Spiders 2.0\n\n \n\nVanilla spiders are not yet creepy enough for you?

to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n¬†\n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":969371,"followers":1185,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"FKmzXNtY","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"6RqzXTwc","featured":false,"name":"Fastload-1.2.1","version_number":"1.18.2.fabric.1.2.1","changelog":"Upload latest to modrinth","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-10-22T13:31:04.794831Z","downloads":52009,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f748552b4fc192034af6143b0b4906943d8b0ed3","sha512":"1c22ad9b907997632704c4a065c5a4be3fc8de22b678f4107b075bab6f235b4c07ee3d3c4082cf29ad6ec2a79f05714f64a18e3d18dd2a6a48c2e429eb883bc2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/FKmzXNtY/Fastload-1.2.1.jar","filename":"Fastload-1.2.1.jar","primary":true,"size":33067,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"KirboSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a junior software engineer who creates minecraft mods in my spare time and help with projects when I can","created":"2022-06-04T15:56:54.106893Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Co-owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Fastload-1.2.1.jar"},"mods\\dynamic-fps-3.2.1+minecraft-1.19.0.jar":{"sha512":"7b11c026945feffa651a42d7cd9092a3f166f0afdd7d0874a40c4b470ae1b39e21b610056d8cedf8df81facbeacf6173931511b3ffe8185c8b60adbaac8503d9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LQ3K71Q1","slug":"dynamic-fps","project_type":"mod","team":"qgYomxyl","title":"Dynamic FPS","description":"Improve performance when Minecraft is in the background.","body":"Dynamic FPS automatically reduces the speed at which Minecraft renders when it's not focused (to 1 FPS) or hidden (no renders at all).\n\nIt also fixes a bug in Vanilla Minecraft that makes it take much more performance in the background than it should, as well as making the game not render while reloading resources (which can make it take forever on machines with integrated GPUs).\n\nThere is an in-game config screen.

In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB.

So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes.

It does this by caching all of its content on first launch\n    and on next launch loading back that exact cache. The cache loading is hyper fast and scalable which utilises your\n    entire system. <br/><br/><br/> <strong>Important notes:</strong> <!-- Cache slowdown explanation --> <br/><br/>\n    &bull; The first time your launch DashLoader it will be <strong>significantly slower</strong>. Because it needs to\n    create a cache which contains all the assets minecraft normally loads. This will also happen every time you change a\n    mod/resourcepack if that configuration does not have an existing cache. <!-- Mod compatibility --> <br/><br/> &bull;\n    DashLoader has been known to be incompatible with a lot of mods. DashLoader 3.0 has massively improved compatibility\n    by not forcing mod developers to add explicit support to make their assets cachable. This means that DashLoader will\n    load assets normally for mod assets that cannot be cached. While this improves mod compatibility it hurts speed as\n    the minecraft loading system is quite slow. <!-- Artists --> <br/><br/> &bull; If you use DashLoader for Developing\n    mods or creating resource packs you can press <code>f3 + t</code> to recreate the cache to load your new assets in.\n    If you want to just show off the speed of DashLoader you can press <code>shift + f3 + t</code> <br/><br/><br/>\n    <!-- Community -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/community-new.png\" alt=\"Community\"\n         width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"https://discord.gg/VeFTrtCkrb\">\n        <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qbysL1T.png\" alt=\"Discord\" width=\"500\"/>\n    </a>\n    <!-- Sponsors -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/sponsors-new.png\" alt=\"Sponsors\" width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/\">YourKit</a>\n    Makes amazing profilers for both Java and .NET.\n    We use their Java Profiler to understand where to optimize further and make DashLoader faster. <br/>\n    <a\n            href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\">JetBrains\n    </a>\n    Creates excellent IDEs for all programmers and have provided us\n    with access to their enterprise products for use to develop DashLoader and Hyphen.\n    <!-- Donate -->\n    <img\n            src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/donate-new.png\" alt=\"Donate\" width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/> I have a\n    <a\n            href=\"https://ko-fi.com/notequalalpha\">Ko-Fi page\n    </a>\n    if you would like to Support me. <br/> Please only support\n    me if you like what I do, and you are not in a bad financial situation to do so.\n</p>","published":"2021-04-19T09:11:56.149026Z","updated":"2023-08-14T08:07:28.472035Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":538223,"followers":1659,"categories":["library","optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["BV1ALjca","qCSFZJDC","9eCZGA4u","zlSHmaBO","r4TfbmIo","uoZ9GRQf","6XZ8uzBM","8Fdayh7u","OnYC2zew","zCsGOJZc","se6qU2fa","yEJ77Dbe","KBORImrP","vAQbBj1w","HV2NHpfY","k9vsytTC","IbL8S9Tt","CsYSbmtE","Gct6yfbT","h1VgG4ob","Oub3E7JL","8vYUAyOO","fZNzww9k","EqfM9CWW","Y9ZKQAAS","QaDgUeVV","PcGOE5fz","WdNFKue4","3mMWMjAJ","FQY8wtX3","xps3tiEt","nJuq0bM2","OTK7ITDv","JQ7pEK4s","Av1aoyKG","EUniyxEp","uSvjz4bE","HX3WYeGO","bw6BzoC6","fum8FjYI","DsPMHgmj","oDlgxjWQ","bNoZcrPi","XB4YnZ4X","q9pA7KnN","zOVGzQ13","Zt4Hzppp","ctsVVcoF","mswaNhKQ","wDoBtdGY","D6bYfsNQ","VkD2LvlX","BUJc3mxs","xwPC6okA","mcU33FBx","7hqKf7qu","wgtrj8HS"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZfQ3kTvR/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"DsPMHgmj","project_id":"ZfQ3kTvR","author_id":"Y5jbSs5O","featured":false,"name":"4.1.3 for 1.19","version_number":"4.1.3+1.19","changelog":"# Fix\n- ssl error which would post an angry exception about us switching domains","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-09-04T14:02:26.500350Z","downloads":148775,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"2acb4a800921fec8bebd809bbf257795a713a6e30b11832da58ccfb7d64788ea4326a4e7adc2302bf44cfdb5eb17dcd03f7f7089093c55602cf87431a2ff6859","sha1":"6e7a6748dcffaaa4e118dd61e43390de960336f9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZfQ3kTvR/versions/DsPMHgmj/dashloader-4.1.3%2B1.19.jar","filename":"dashloader-4.1.3+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":5853809,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Ea3e9kCo","user":{"id":"Y5jbSs5O","username":"alphaqu","name":"Yan Chubikov","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24830855?v=4","bio":"java ideot","created":"2021-04-16T19:37:28.701722Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dashloader-4.1.3+1.19.jar"},"mods\\dynamiccrosshair-3.9+1.19.jar":{"sha512":"de2dc1d47e18a4291625c10c1e14441eeb50100c541623a2bbf9690418cf8454bb46da3954d9e2281cb6bd0ce1cffd84e984744ea715bbb13a110cb67b8a0d3e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZcR9weSm","slug":"dynamiccrosshair","project_type":"mod","team":"Mm7chNKF","title":"Dynamic Crosshair","description":"A mod that hides or changes the crosshair dependent on context","body":"Dynamic Crosshair is a Minecraft mod for the Fabric & Forge launchers.\nIt hides or changes the crosshair dependent on context.\n\n**NOTE: From version 6 on, Cloth-Config has been dropped.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2949415,"followers":4214,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.8.8","1.8.9","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"R0KPBo5r","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"1.5.2 - Fabric 1.19.x ","version_number":"1.5.2-fabric-1.19","changelog":"Fixed issue with the animated skin feature doing 2 requests instead of 1 if installed with 3d Skin Layers.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-08T21:35:10.789256Z","downloads":279076,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ff5520d7b10342358575220d88bd39c8cea80dad","sha512":"230e771a6c6014b1d95d83ffe6ae1ef9d93b054e670f1fb1d2632b47bfe7dc72521aa42b34d3b37f7edd748f110c23066f8f76c4610aecef5d376a772e05f781"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/1.5.2-fabric-1.19/entityculling-fabric-1.5.2-mc1.19.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.5.2-mc1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":75567,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-fabric-1.5.2-mc1.19.jar"},"mods\\puddles-1.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"8cd650a688ebfef84f2b4b8ded1a0794405cf057140c146945e27b3b7f34f82e1b756379daec598f70bae7de171959c386b3a99166469a1846d61dacb4b8fc2d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"535D1YoA","slug":"puddles","project_type":"mod","team":"ES1gax13","title":"Motschen's Puddles","description":"Adds puddles that spawn during rain and thunder!

Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\".

Perhaps if you've not used many resource packs you may not have noticed, but the hotbar has been broken for a long time in Java Edition (<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-67532\">MC-67532</a>). Not only is the selector texture cut off by a couple pixels, but the entire hotbar was actually designed for being raised up off of the bottom of the screen. Restore how it was meant to be and raise it up!</p>\n<p>Please note that, for Minecraft 1.20.2+, Raised requires its own hotbar selector asset, as the GUI atlas was broken up into separate sprites with the hotbar selector now being cut off in texture as well as code!</p>\n<p>Raised features some basic adjustability! Either use the GUI or commands to control the configurable options. See the wiki for more information.</p>\n<p>On the Fabric version, Raised encapsulates the various HUD elements' method calls in the main render method to translate their position on the screen. Mods that inject adjacent to these calls will naturally work, but mods that inject at the head and tail of the render method are also supported. On the Forge version, this works with the HUD elements that are pre-encapsulated by Forge render events. Depending on the game version, it can work with RenderGameOverlayEvent, RenderGuiOverlayEvent, OverlayRegistry, and RegisterGuiOverlaysEvent.</p>\n<p>If you are a mod creator and find that your mod's HUD is not being raised, fear not because Raised supports Object Share on Fabric! See the wiki or use <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/arrows-info\">Arrows Info</a> for an example.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;</p>\n<p><strong>What does this do?</strong></p>\n<p>It fixes the code that cuts off the selector texture on the bottom. As well, all HUD elements are moved up by two pixels like in Bedrock, otherwise the last row of pixels on the selector would never render!</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you need this?</strong></p>\n<p>If you don't want a broken HUD or want to choose where it is on the screen, then Raised is the mod for you!</p>\n<p><strong>What does it require?</strong></p>\n<p><a

performance and lighting errors.\n\nMinecraft 1.20 Light engine changes\n------------------\nPlease see: https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/6cc1acdd03a9b7ac34699bf5e8f1b85c\nTL;DR\nMojang improved upon their own light engine using the same performance critical designs from Starlight. As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")","published":"2021-08-29T14:08:31.790201Z","updated":"2023-12-10T20:26:57.476791Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1719137,"followers":3903,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["nc7qGadJ","p26lbcyI","4ew9whL8","zFqBnsxO","qH1xCwoC","XGIsoVGT","98VOoYPX","PLbxwptm","1QrtjfDy","HZYU0kdg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H8CaAYZC/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qH1xCwoC","project_id":"H8CaAYZC","author_id":"fYyU5YhM","featured":true,"name":"Starlight 1.1.1 1.19 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.1.1+1.19","changelog":"Make game version mismatch less fatal for chunk data","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-17T13:02:20.748923Z","downloads":847533,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"de6fe932555604345477db89b59d59249909c640","sha512":"68f81298c35eaaef9ad5999033b8caf886f3c583ae1edc25793bdd8c2cbf5dce6549aa8d969c55796bd8b0d411ea8df2cd0aaeb9f43adf0691776f97cebe1f9f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H8CaAYZC/versions/1.1.1%2B1.19/starlight-1.1.1%2Bfabric.ae22326.jar","filename":"starlight-1.1.1+fabric.ae22326.jar","primary":true,"size":127465,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DXoc0ko3","user":{"id":"fYyU5YhM","username":"spottedleaf","name":"Spottedleaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6100722?v=4","bio":"Developer of Folia, Starlight & Paper.","created":"2021-08-29T13:50:25.716250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"starlight-1.1.1+fabric.ae22326.jar"},"mods\\enhancedblockentities-0.7.1+1.19.jar":{"sha512":"b1a78f509b8da64012a498618eefdebdf9fb720ce01b1b118084725d9f07f7e577ab416cbe705368e5255ef0db0d955f4766dd25e167e9fdbda8a6d36ee34ce0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OVuFYfre","slug":"ebe","project_type":"mod","team":"O79BATDr","title":"Enhanced Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With

to interact with dropped items, hence the name.

When on the ground, they'll lay flat and compact stacks\n\n¬†\n\n - **Enhanced Pickup and Tooltips**: You can pick up items by right-clicking them, even from a few blocks away. When looking at one, you'll see it's tooltip rendered below your crosshair.\n\n¬†\n\n - **Item Filter**: The Item Filter is an Item that allows you to finely control which items you want to automatically pick up. You can configure it to use either a white- or blacklist and any items affected by that lsit will require you to explicitly pick them up using either a right-click or by sneaking. You can also globally disable auto-pickup in the config to force everyone to explicitly pick up all items.\n\n¬†\n\n - **Item Throwing**: You can throw items by holding down the drop key for a period of time. The longer you hold it, the further you'll throw it. Items which have a damage modifier on them like Sword and Axes will also deal damage when they hit something after being thrown this way.\n\n¬†\n\n - **Client-Only Mode**: You can use Interactic in a mode where it will automatically disable all server-side features and give you only the enhanced rendering and tooltips.\n\n¬†\n\nAll of these features can be individually toggled in the config","published":"2021-08-03T19:06:42.818734Z","updated":"2024-01-11T18:19:01.446075Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":224301,"followers":263,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18-pre8","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-pre3","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["xiTAqyPB","kicm7pvf","FlxdQ0Cf","YArmqQMg","7OfiG1Wu","fVMWmsTh","bahB0VI3","D7g1PZ50","gPRyWa8f","WhjBkxuI","KaaebHRh","3ZriHPeX","7LmnFHXo","tj8ZH9jV","kt7gW3fF","BukcqFnZ","M0c0R0nD","PYdrXIcA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ErpAAAaf/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"7LmnFHXo","project_id":"ErpAAAaf","author_id":"qGOpk8Hs","featured":false,"name":"[1.19+] Interactic - 0.1.11","version_number":"0.1.11+1.19","changelog":"### Changes\n - Block items can now be configured to always lay flat on the ground\n\n### Fixes\n - The Item Filter screen's button now properly respect the filter's state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-09-27T17:27:48.234345Z","downloads":113074,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"08ad06f42de2a29be5768c233dedf957ec7355c1","sha512":"a8839bcc7a2754dc2fc8e4d6042dec6ac6d08dc8ed8a46f8212c3424cd9059fc8cbde4ed84de94acc1dc340e2444948dc2421300edd708249c65e742b9e0fa6b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ErpAAAaf/versions/7LmnFHXo/interactic-0.1.11%2B1.19.jar","filename":"interactic-0.1.11+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":95231,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EOzKiDsm","user":{"id":"qGOpk8Hs","username":"glisco","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15788224?v=4","bio":"she/her | creative director & tech lead\n@ Wisp Forest (https://github.com/wisp-forest)\n\n","created":"2021-03-13T09:39:29.068275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"interactic-0.1.11+1.19.jar"},"mods\\lazydfu-0.1.3.jar":{"sha512":"dc3766352c645f6da92b13000dffa80584ee58093c925c2154eb3c125a2b2f9a3af298202e2658b039c6ee41e81ca9a2e9d4b942561f7085239dd4421e0cce0a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"hvFnDODi","slug":"lazydfu","project_type":"mod","team":"7w9mvv0o","title":"LazyDFU","description":"Makes the game boot faster by deferring non-essential initialization","body":"LazyDFU is an optimization mod for Minecraft that defers unnecessary initialization work so that it is only performed if required. Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1851518,"followers":3323,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

[Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.","published":"2020-12-21T17:48:09.050177Z","updated":"2024-01-02T01:58:46.262754Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1460841,"followers":2581,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["tO4HJpLA","19624YsD","7AwqDL7J","Ff90AgU6","PGovBIXq","AXYWaIE8","kCiWZ1wv","QmrcLtH3","vJQ7plH2","UJ6FlFnK","vx0mZa04","Tncui9tU","jiDwS0W1","cQ60Ouax","X2k7QAQS","bRcuOnao"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"UJ6FlFnK","project_id":"fQEb0iXm","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.2.0","version_number":"0.2.0","changelog":"This is not just a Minecraft 1.19 update, it's also a feature release!\n\n* Fixes crash with Lithium on Quilt\n* Resynced with latest Velocity code\n* Send chunk packets in a spiral pattern and other fixes (contributed by @solonovamax)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-08T00:56:17.435349Z","downloads":90583,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4ef667c6e053dd22e3e8cfa6299a75069af858ad","sha512":"699100296a536caf90926ce0e07d6cbb2fe773f4ec5455d30dd650d5a01fdfb1a4c5ae50ae42b792e0d05f56f9f0a8fc359fc4879b6e7a99007fe29b38cca3fe"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/versions/0.2.0/krypton-0.2.0.jar","filename":"krypton-0.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":146115,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LBcJZJkm","user":{"id":"y0WF9UR5","username":"astei","name":"Andrew Steinborn","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16436212?v=4","bio":"Sometime Minecraft modder, currently an software engineer at the fintech startup Ramp","created":"2020-12-21T14:36:31.896442Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"krypton-0.2.0.jar"},"mods\\effective-1.3.jar":{"sha512":"5ae60e81b17e736ee35bab923e8f606034131e52d1ac09b7303592f2272eb657d6f077f307a1b12f8786ba237be7b91aeff7e9f6003f1cf6ed55d8b6e41aac9b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Effective","description":"A client-side mod adding ambient and environmental interaction effects to enhance immersion.","authors":["doctor4t"],"version":"1.3","icon":"C:\\Users\\maxwe\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\4f6b131cc74a1820f84818a4e0730af7adc4106e.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"effective-1.3.jar"},"mods\\boat-fall-1.1.3.jar":{"sha512":"64af32121fd541d2f7696012c3f3163d0e77eeffb928a1924adec3f60a61a4bee25757eeb8dfc068aba42928fa8ffc80fb0ddfb2298d52775cf1261917fae2f6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"R1GcscrS","slug":"boat-fall","project_type":"mod","team":"tbKYZsjp","title":"Boat Fall","description":"Makes boats and their passengers take fall damage","body":"# Boat Fall\n\nThis mod is a port of a fix from [RandomPatches](https://github.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches) for [MC-98160](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-98160) and [MC-105103](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105103).

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies.

Build the shader you want! All the effects are optional!, and you will only consume the resources that you need.\n\n**¬°Compatible with Optifine and Iris!**\n\n## Optional features:\n\n* Shadows\n* Optional volumetric clouds\n* Antialiasing (TAA)\n* Depth of field\n* Enhanced ambient occlusion\n* Water reflection and refraction\n* Motion blur\n* Optional bloom\n* Optional chromatic aberration\n* Auto-exposure\n* Shader for all native dimensions\n* FAST!\n* And more...\n\n## Tested on\n\n* Minecraft 1.12.+ - 1.18.x\n* Nvidia, Intel, AMD (It's not guaranteed to work on each and every existing model)\n* Windows and Linux\n\n## You can\n\n* You can use the shader without restrictions.\n* You can fork the shader from: [https://github.com/javiergcim/MakeUpUltraFast](https://github.com/javiergcim/MakeUpUltraFast)\n* You can modify this shader for any purpose.\n* If you modify or use the shader PLEASE add a credit.\n\n## Color schemes\n\nIt can be boring that everything looks the same all the time. Choose a color scheme according to your tastes and change it whenever you want.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nLeave Optifine's native shader options at their default values, otherwise you may see shader quality reduced. Customize using only the options of the shader itself.\n\nShadows and depth of field are resource-intensive effects. You can remove them if you need more performance, and it will still look great.\n\n## Donation\n\nIf you think this work deserves a small stipend, please donate! I will be eternally grateful to you:\n\n[Donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4N9Q5RMZL2CVN)","published":"2023-01-28T02:06:57.945289Z","updated":"2023-11-11T20:12:36.542517Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":241191,"followers":365,"categories":["potato","semi-realistic","shadows"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","fantasy","foliage","low","medium","reflections"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["giJQJsir","nq7l7BcV","Rml9AYAP","yt7KFLEm","1MLTwdqr","AQ14CMui","qFEY5xhc","HZOCaLH4","UEwFm12B","p567E3yc","nsJKZvEg","oy4w4qBJ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/izsIPI7a/837881b08df8ed8a7a43b48484bcbfd62c301142.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"nsJKZvEg","project_id":"izsIPI7a","author_id":"VoROpsYm","featured":false,"name":"MakeUp Ultra Fast v8.9a","version_number":"8.9a","changelog":"# Changes:\n\n- Adjusted the way the glow of metal objects is generated and added missing metal objects.\n- Fixed a typo of the word \"strength\" throughout all code and translations (thanks to artelidiot).\n- Adjusted the DOF focus speed to work better in normal gameplay (with the latest versions of Iris the object in the hand no longer causes problems).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-30T01:40:02.529923Z","downloads":36085,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"09991fb9520026c8eb4f26e30a3f7bdc8472a015","sha512":"c84fc4d1ca0a258f329be4125ff1df34c077349f85700b170feb863f4db9bb59251cec939beec4a174172adae59586ce12c5051541ef4b947fea7101b7b38284"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/izsIPI7a/versions/nsJKZvEg/MakeUp-UltraFast-8.9a.zip","filename":"MakeUp-UltraFast-8.9a.zip","primary":true,"size":338028,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"OY8on704","user":{"id":"VoROpsYm","username":"javiergcim","name":"Javier Gardu√±o","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/VoROpsYm/66f4ee9942f39e08bddffeb7fa2dd7d670f9e7e1.webp","bio":"A simple computer scientist, interested in AI, artificial life, maths, web development, and many, many more.\r\n\r\nRead me in: https://esceptica.net","created":"2023-01-28T02:03:43.256716Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MakeUp-UltraFast-8.9a.zip"},"mods\\darkness-fabric-mc119-2.0.94.jar":{"sha512":"79617c9b90b3a8b86c3a258b8d59448e8d39bebe698326028837dc029bff64ee4fa8c282c5209db6380e8b25ac1f79fe6395a0cbd1110da7b0103656bd2d4589","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Ja7zPEaN","slug":"true-darkness","project_type":"mod","team":"M6ObEA78","title":"True Darkness","description":"Moody brightness not dark enough?

adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"143\" height=\"50\">\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons adds **four seasons** to Minecraft, each lasting 28 in-game days (configurable). The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2021-05-09T15:41:27.109292Z","updated":"2023-08-12T09:38:01.813799Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":434296,"followers":791,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17-pre1","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18-rc4","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["LhCaMIzy","jQoWa0il","zQt9Dd2v","McebIuW7","gtoXC9cr","t3cqWJpS","ZSlExvBh","nBxZtduO","k55LHPVG","hNV4laag","UBlv1O6X","JoW6p4c5","tXjlq5P9","SgKuDqln","UYBTrmgB","tjP6OtOn","FWErjNOd","Gil5sfVD","G7yrUl8Y","866aPKAj","k9JfRwVM","3wVgEG0u","7EU0UwXc","rLlocL2I","5yFOnFEL","QlPte8FN","dJtxMqxE","5TNKN9aR","sX1BCX14","hp6m6aJl","uMEzKato"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/7ce47fcb4242493ad069789298400b14f27737ad.png"},"version":{"id":"hNV4laag","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons 1.4-BETA","version_number":"1.4-BETA+1.19","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-21T02:45:38.185168Z","downloads":125373,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ae1a9d37c0a0d29ebc8abd69d8599b18ddb417be19233b1f3c0fa200e76571d46560437a01bba641eb290320380e1bc4e88874eb94b0faaddb436e2f70dd9d6b","sha1":"aebfa31dd8694ad7dcd72b978d3c619a260f6175"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/versions/1.4-BETA%2B1.19/fabric-seasons-1.4-BETA%2B1.19.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-1.4-BETA+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":257147,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qABOlhS9","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-1.4-BETA+1.19.jar"},"mods\\notenoughanimations-fabric-1.6.4-mc1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"6df16b749c742d2999eabe7f434265f378ca24ceb9c0dedeb3c2c4df81555b7003a010906c4db8d9ec8628f52d6ae60d30b25072377d4e7b2faefb8c29396790","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MPCX6s5C","slug":"not-enough-animations","project_type":"mod","team":"Eayl8ao3","title":"Not Enough Animations","description":"Bringing first-person animations to the third-person","body":"# Not Enough Animations \n\nThis mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person.

It works in single-player, and clients connecting to servers with it don't need it installed.\n\n</center>\n\n---\n\n## No Sneaking Over Magma!\n\nInspired as the counterpart to [Sneak Through Berries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sneakthroughberries)!\n> ~~Why Mojang lets you sneak on literal magma but not through bushes... idk~~\n\nMojang might, but I don't!\n\nMakes it so that you take damage on magma blocks even while sneaking.\n\nIncludes other options for damaging and setting fire to entities on magma.\n\n---\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Configuration</summary>\n\nConfiguration requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files),\nand configuring the mod in-game requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions).\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Sneaking protects from magma (default: false)\n- Frostwalker protects from magma (default: true)\n- Magma damages non-living entities (default: false)\n- Magma sets fire to entities (default: false)\n- Download translation updates (default: true): Download translations from Crowdin when the game launches\n \n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to translate No Sneaking Over Magma, follow [this link](https://crwd.in/no_sneaking_over_magma).\n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license is [MIT](https://will-lucic.mit-license.org/), however, so anyone else is free to port it.\n\nI'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links

and server.\n\n</center>\n\n---\n\nIf you're looking for this functionality on Forge, check out [Boat Behavior Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/boat-behavior-tweaks) by [shwible_gaming](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/shwible_gaming/projects)!\n\nThis mod makes it so boats don't go any faster on ice blocks than they do on dirt.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell it doesn't make a lot of sense that in vanilla boats move faster on ice than on water.\n\nAlso, there are loads of more interesting ways of traveling quickly in minecraft that are largely made obsolete by the existence of ice boats, like:\n- piston bolts\n- dolphin highways\n- simple railways\n- piston worms\n\n![chicken watching boat](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nQgj_OzYuXMMYVMk9Gw5Houl72MwgV1Ek2KfLM3Pp0VeCkegV0u1OeYa3xI0z-3tq96TAp6lJHdo9izcnB63VlftsXSlZcbgTzuDDJFRlwFbqWBQ_fTv2eB1MhkeJ7xuQ7z5eTdamflvBdPOr4AxHoUArVQn0Dq8ZUHDUd-OgrtOwgi4ZXtKNa5FZ8yAvg_J3sAZGozVdAQD_FmbQLEG8uysQRilwSvjaBnB608pj8RtjIb-53z3Qcp5mWH9GUIukUXbe4kN0zMUebwy4PyS1lt3QFApAXYc6lS1gfZnp0SqLAmMgl5zv7SwSLRJ7OXKhRJD1Bm8EJcJIzHdCpxMeDUA-MlcZgNkhZfO_i34svUCeh36_tpY4OmZsFo8V5KxjjQyEhBWHni-rnws9m0NOR3gF0vT1IQ8L1CsY5XnBkVF786As7TYgw9NtsFTBvcutFiIG7i-qOE8yR_D6WGZsR8vXIvfRuz4lQj6sNI8XlXXK9NkRJzmmNw7XZ-uBhItwNrwof_6S5w_v40bFy6xBUUbxAaC-c11oxFOZ7W1xy6QYBvhrOGTNyn5CsxFVFNFgI8nuOXPYmF4YrShuMlNLBrLa-KWfzI8gobok51uEfWIFkIQNYP_cGQjtrt9mlpN9nFPgVsvdAXSNHewQKSs4FaSdLa3wvUUbXUV3R_OPW_e7DfMErES3GSjlRVC_jKukqMb=w3845-h1880-ft)\n\nSo if you want to make use of all these other interesting mechanics but don't want to feel like your effort is wasted on these complex but second-rate forms of transport, install this mod!\n\nEnjoy the realism of chickens casually walking past your boat as you try in vain to propel it forward by scraping the paddles across the surface of the ice!\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license is [MIT](https://will-lucic.mit-license.org/), however, so anyone else is free to port it.\n\nI'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links aren't required.","published":"2021-06-16T05:49:12.536320Z","updated":"2024-01-28T22:27:42.212078Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":68286,"followers":17,"categories":["adventure","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["1SSAV6v7","YN6Hwu8s","cZfYCZNF","Asdy3QoV","FIebqzSQ","AB9oTLbl","5PT0VWTD","4OglKzuJ","mB6MHZ4M","XoyHAKIb","4VgCKuIa","OHBq9IDM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Udjno5eL/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4VgCKuIa","project_id":"Udjno5eL","author_id":"LxSEd81o","featured":false,"name":"1.0.16+MC1.18-1.20.2","version_number":"1.0.16+MC1.18-1.20.2","changelog":" Marked as compatible with 1.20.2\n\nA cumulative changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/supersaiyansubtlety/ice_boat_nerf/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-06T01:05:11.925267Z","downloads":24882,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0a2ff4f6c64ef27db184efb9b541f5e6d8a227fc0d8f0ab342768344d1219f8a20020346dee0b4db3d4ed45ee2995ba0edfbe8bf06bad446becff044db0cd270","sha1":"de1cd694a1586a252ee643ad553f32a6542af730"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Udjno5eL/versions/4VgCKuIa/ice-boat-nerf-1.0.16%2BMC1.18-1.20.2.jar","filename":"ice-boat-nerf-1.0.16+MC1.18-1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":100524,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LLNFG92W","user":{"id":"LxSEd81o","username":"supersaiyansubtlety","name":"Will","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/618276?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-14T17:10:51.649412Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ice-boat-nerf-1.0.16+MC1.18-1.20.2.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":"mU4d2SPO"}
